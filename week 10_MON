#slef practice

do not panic if u r a sentencen behind the speech 

pay attention to speaker-related everything! (e.g. tone, feeling, certainty level, etc....)



#IS 

DO TKAE PAUSES
so that u give uslef some time to think about what u r going to say 
good way to avoid hestitations and fillers 

DO VIDEO RECORD ur self 

Technical terms: nicn if u can have them correctly. or u can explain them, that is also good.

try to reduce repetition as hard as u can.
as long as the sentence makes sense. get on with ur speech. 

note taking: LESS IS MORE 

#slef-practcing 

lack of gernal knowledge & common sense

filler: 所以. 因为。

if u r not so sure about something. probably just do not say it pls. otherwise u r in a great risk of distorting information. 

too much unecessary repetition

note down the agent as soon as u hear it

note down the time as soon as u hear it 

note down the numbers WITH ITS REFERENCE
