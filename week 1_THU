Did MODL5001M method in translation today. 

The way Jeremy Munday talking was really funny. Intonation was absent from his utterances. Students were bored, but it seemed like he didn't care anyway.

What is translation or interpreting? Jeremy just told us to read books and journals 

Regarding the translation commentary, Jeremy strongly favours those that come up with REAL reasons, not just saying 'cuz it sounds better'. 

Try to back up your preferred translation with systematic reasons.

Can't just say 'literal'/'free' translation. They are hard to define.
