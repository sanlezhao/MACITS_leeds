#listening to the record from last FRI during peer practice#

too many fillers 'so'
too many repetitions
lack of intonation
some vowels are not pronouced correctly


#self-practice round 1#

poor word collocation 
lack of fluency
the sentence structure is too complex for oral presentation
too many self-corrects
