#round two

ovrall. poor delivery of the oringinal speech.

major distortion at the introduction: did not note down verb, resulting in difficulty of deciphering the notes. 

major distortion due to noting down wrong synbols. 

always missed the latter part of the sentence. too much attention on note taking.

uncomfortable hesitations when delivering iinterpretation

lack of fluency in target language 

detail missing significantly. regardless of the wieght of the details. 

U NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH UR WORDS

#listen to the orcit resource video 

always rememeber to note down LESS at the intrioduction part of the specch 
and 
note down MORE at the conclusion of the speech 

have a list of things that need to be improved, then see how note-taking can help u.

always only note things down after u have understood it
as if u do not udnerstand the notes. they are useless to u
