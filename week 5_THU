#listen to the yesterday's recording#

be careful with the 'there be' construction 

filler:
kind of 

monotonous.
when the strucrture of the speech is not clear and i am nor sure what to say. intonation suffers. 

too much hesitations 

not enough real content in your speech


i need to prepare a speech on LGBT rights, social media 

regarding the use of english, pay special attention to the articles, 

keep the syntax and the setence structure simple. 
simple past tense is your best friend. 

keep a good pace (avoid being too slow or fast), pause where suitable. 

you need to use proper register in your speech. normally the registers used in BBC news are dimed fit. 

i need to aviod the usage of bland words. 

a few things that can immediately downgrade the register:
1. contractions: use because instead of cuz. use although instead of though.
2. insert nouns (except pronouns) into verb+prep. combination. (e.g. take out the rubbish instead of take the rubbish out)


do not say wrods such as: like, sort of, thing,...

#interpreting skills#

practice and practice!

method of improving your note-taking:
1. interprete a speech with note taking 
2. look back to your notes. see if anything can be improved. look for notes that you did not understand and try to improve them.
3. relisten to the speech. think about where you can do better regarding your note-taking.
4. write you new notes/ upgraded versions of notes down for future reference.

i need to particuclarly work on the interpretation of numbers.

distortion of the oringinal idea is extremely dangerous. almost as devastating as missing the main ideas. AVIOD IT AT ALL COST. 

be specific with time. is it after? or is it before? you cannot afford making mesitakes on this information.

AND I REALLY REALLY NEED MORE PRACTICE
