#listening to the recording from yesterday's practice#

cut down the size of your sentence,. shorter sentences make your speech easier to understand.
THINK IN ENGLISH WHEN YOU ARE SPEAKING IN ENGLISH
i find out that when the structure of the speech is not clear, i tend to focus on organizing my speech while speaking, and therefore ignore my intonation, sress or pause.
