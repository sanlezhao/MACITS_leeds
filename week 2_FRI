i need to have my corpora prepared before each class eacl week. 

before each assignment, prior to your interpretation. you should tell the interlocutors: "hello, i'm your interpreter today, and i'm going to interpret everthing you say."

do not let note taking take too much of your brain capacity. the really important thing is always active listening and analyzing.

i made mistakes in today's liaison interpretation (as always). one of the interloutors asked me for clarification, i didn't interprete her request to other interlocutors. instead, i answered the question myself. this is very unprofessional, i should not do that.

when come across unfamiliar proper names. we have three strategies. if you heared it clear, you can repeat it in english in you interpretation, or you can transliterate it into chinese. if you didn't hear it clear, you should ask for clarification to the speaker, but do tell the other parties that you are going to ask for clarification.
