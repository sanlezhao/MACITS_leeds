#self practice in the morning

PLS DO SAY WHAT U HAVE NOTED DOWN. OTHERWISE THE NOTES ARE WASTED. 
(perhaps becuase u cannot link the info properly?)

filler: 所以

miss the importance level again

bad interpretation due to:
umfamiliarity with the topic
failure of understanding due to some un familiar vocab 

STAMINA: toward the end of the interpretation, i (unintentionally) added distorted information.


#self practicing round 2

u r expected to recognize ur notes with a glance
and pls remember what symbols stands for what

agent missing 
wrong tone 

#self practice round 3

missing agent leads to major distortion (distortion of main idea!!!!)

main idea is very difficult to be missed. but not so much if u stop listening to the speaker.
