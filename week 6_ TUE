# english as a retour exam#

today i had the retoru exam. i am not satisfied with my performance. i cuold do better.
but it is fine. next week whe i do consecutive interpreting. i will do better.

i was a bit nervous, and my mind turned blank when i was delivering the presentation.
therfore i might be making grammartical mistakes without even noticing.
