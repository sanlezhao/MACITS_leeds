today's class didn't go on smoothly, but i've learned a lot from it.

deverbalization may be the central part of interpretation, but what comes after it? truned out that is DECODE, which means to transform the meaning you just extracted into another languagel. then comes the fifth step SYNTHESIZE, which means to construcrt the meanings into sentences in the target language.

listen really hard for the LINKING WORDS such as 'but, so,...' they indicate the logic behind the words and the sentences

i found that i tend to forget the introduction part of the speech. all the information tends to be simplified by my memory. this is particularly bad. as according to my experience in today's class, the main ideas are extracted more detailed than i expected. they are not that general at all.  

pay attention to the FRAMING of the information: who is the agency? is this the opinion of the speaker itself? is the speaker certain about it?

you need to read the oringinal document more carefully. how can you translate without fully understanding the original??
give some time for digestion after reading the original document 
proof read at least once after finish the translation 

may be i can also apply deverbalization here....
