#peer practice#

I know that all my classmates have their strenghs. some of them already have some experience in translation & interpreting. some of them are alost native in English. some of them just have this talent of doing translation & interpreting.
but i am no worse than them if not stronger. perhaps i do not have many practical experience of doing interpreting or perhaps my english is not native-like or perhaps i am even not so talentive in interpreting.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. I AM BOLD I AM PROGRESSING EVERY SINGLE DAY. NO ONE IS MORE DESPERATE THAN ME IN GAINING PROGRESS. I DO WHAT I CAN AND I DO NOT EVER MESS IMPORTANT THINGS UP.

accuracy of my retell still needs to be improved. 

i found its effective to write fewer things in one page. it makes you recall more, and read less.

i found myself sometimes reapeat symbols that mean the same thing when taking notes. this wast time and takes your brain capacity. so do not do that again.

the final and yet the most important step of practicing interpreting is to relisten to your recording of yourself. without the final step, all your previous efforts are NOTHING!
