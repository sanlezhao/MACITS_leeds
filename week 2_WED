so the global message of the speech is really important, do not mess up with that! if you do, you will probably end up failing the exam!

if the whole speech is a tree, you have to keep your tree the same as the speaker's. maybe small changes in some leaves, but no trunks please.
i should try pretty hard to keep the oringinal shape of the tree. 

i need to prepare for the weekly topic each week BEFORE class, doing some research. the tutor mentioned that like literally five times in class.

my existing knowledge of the relevant topic really helps me to understand and interprete the speech. that means that i should not just get the word, but also the ESSENCE/MEANING of the word.
maybe to explain things a little bit.

why understanding the logic is so important? i think it helps you to make sense of the whole speech, and consequently helps your interpretation.
it's fine missing a coupld of words in the speech. this is the way English works. but the thing is you need to remain calm and work out the main idea of that section.

说短句，长长的句子很难懂欸

you should make your interpretation easy to undersatnd. think about the listeners! always think about them!
and do not make up nonsense when you can not remember, this is very unprofessional, and is damaging to your career.
