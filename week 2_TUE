Personal tutoring from Binhua 
Binhua had our first personal tutor meeting in a very short notice, which i disliekd. i was not a fan of him, but it turned out that he maybe a fine person. 
he addressed a letter from a professional interpreter with reputation. he said he will upload the letter. i might need to take a good look at it tomorrow. 
as an language professional, i do need to pay extra attention to the register (i.e. be careful with the word choice)
and i must not make up things in my interpretation! i can only reasonable deduce if i can't recall, and i was not being sarcastic.
i was suprised to learn that i have to ensure that i have three-hours' outside-class interpretation practice! three hours! every day! to be a good interpreter! well it sounds hard, but i will try anyway.
and i was suprised to learn that i was not supposed to practice a training material jiut once. instead i should practice multiple times until i am satisfied with my performance.
