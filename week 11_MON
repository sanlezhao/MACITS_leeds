in the consecutive final. it is not the terminologies that is hard. 
it is the logic flow and the structure of arguments that are important.

make sure that u follow the logic flow of the speaker. 

make sure u copy the argument structure of the speaker.

even better, u should frame the arguments exactly the speaker formulates them.
