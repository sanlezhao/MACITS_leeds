#consecutive with notes#

there are still a lot more need to be improved on my performance.

i need to LISTEN TO MYSELF when giving presentation and when doing interpreting. in my interpretation today, there were some conflicting information on number.

the accuracy of my interpretation needs to be improved. some details are missed from my interpretation. remember, with note-taking, your accuracy is expected to be improved.

all the numbers you note down should have units with them. 

pay attention to yor TENSE. today's speech was about a research done before, but you used present tense all the way through your interpretation.

i had difficulty dicipher my notes. so i need to develop a better note symble system.
i forgot to ACTIVE LISTEN in thoday's interpretation, which also contributes to my bad performance.

i somehow thought there is no need to review the notes. but I WAS WRONG, it is actually a very good way of improving your symble system. 

i need to practice a speech at least twice.
