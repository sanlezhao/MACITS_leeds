#consecutive without notes#

today we got deeper into note-taking. this class introduced us some note-taking techiniques.
but it began by informing us why to take notes.
from my understanding, note taking should serve as a build-up skill upon all your existing skills.
so yes it is challenging to do the multi taksing, but you performance is expected to be better when you incorporate note-taking. 
more specifically, the structure,the completeness, and the accuracy of your speech is expected to be better.

note taking should provide clues for your memory. the word on your note should not represent just a word. it should reprent the idea. and the prerequsite of note-taking is defenitely ACTIVE LISTENING.

notes should be the ABBREVIATION OF KEY WORDs    

links are very important. sometimes they are expressed clearly in the speech, sometimes they are implied, but you should always work them out. they belong to the left sdie section of your notes.

your notes are your meta language. they are language free. you do not have to write in a specific type of language.

a good consecutive interpretation should be 60% ACTIVE LISTENING & 40% note-taking 

the first tutor encourages us to develop our own note-taking system by practicing transcribing the speech transcription with our note-taking system.

so i figured you can o many notes when you are actually doing consecutive interpreting.
