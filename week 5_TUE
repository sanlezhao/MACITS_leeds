#review previous translation#

you need to ensure that you review your translation at least once after you finish translating. this can improve the fluency of your translation. 
i have the tendency of being redundant. i can make my translation more concise by firstly cutting off some repetitive pronouns.

DO NOT TRANSLATE WORD TO WORD. YOU NEED TO GRASP THE MEANING.
this also applies to look up the word in a chinese english dictionary. a word can have several different translations, depending on the context.

when translating. you can save the titles to the last, or at least after you looking through the whole article.

yes short sentences are desirable, but fluency is important too.

where i got the meanings wrong, i did not expect that these phrases/words can have that kind of meaning. 

i need to READ more news articles in CHINSESE. i will do that everyngiht before bed
