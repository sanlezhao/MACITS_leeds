#listen to the recording from yesterday#

#round 1#

secondary ideas partial:
        you have to REMEMBER part of the speech. especially secondary ideas. you cannot note everything down!
        
filler:
然后



articulation: audience feel not involved.
                monotonus
                
links: the logic of the whole interpretation is not flowing very well. this is becuase you did not understand the logic of that part of the speech, due to paying too much attention to note taking.

有些词用的太大了。distortion 


#round 2#

links missing. pay attention to the links of the oringinal speech!

不要用“所以”做filler！！it is the worst filler possible. 
filler: 然后

pause应用的不够好

说道不确定的地方的时候，在开口之前先停顿一下，想一下要说什么，这是合理停顿，完全不会对整体翻译造成不良影响

you are focusing too much on words when you are deciphering your notes. you should rememebr that your notes are also just hints that remind you of the content of the speech. please DO NOT SIGHT TRANSLATE YOUR NOTES!!


DO NOTE SIGHT TRANSLATE YOUR NOTES!!

#round 3#
