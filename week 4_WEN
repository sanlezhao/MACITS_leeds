#consecutive interpreting#

today we further investigated on the usage of margin.
according to the feedback from the tutor and the classmates and even the feedback from my translating tutor, my interpretation & translation have the large framework, but really lack details. 
i really need to be more PRECISE. this is a problem that i need to deal with NOW FROM THIS MOMENT. otherwise it will become a big problem of mine.

i did not put the agent of the action in the margin.
i did remember to put the linking words in the margin area, which is good.
i did not put time or names in the margin.

DO NOT put any unprocessed information in the margin area.
the margin is your VIP area, only IMPORTANT PROCESSED INFO can go in there. 


whatever works for you is good. however pls bare in mind: some methods are popular for a reason. if many people find it useful, give it a try.

you of course do not need to have thousands of symbols. you cannot remember them anyway. your symbol system has to be ORGANIC and FLEXIBLE. 
do not focus too much on your notepad. if you focus too much on taking notes, chances are, you are not ACTIVE LISTENING anymore, and you are therefore bond to have bad output.

i did focus a bit too much on taking notes today, which serviously mess up with my active listening. i ended up failed to comprehend part of the speech.

DO NOT attempt to write eyerything down. 
DO NOT write any thing that stands for its own. any symbol on your notepad should represent a block of idea, a trunck of information.

i am quite suprised to know that as an interpreter, you are supposed to know the names of all parts of the body when it comes to medical interpreting. i should definitely work on that.

the ways the questions are framed is important.

as a public service interpreter, you need to honest and upfront. correct your mistake. do not attempt to conver it.
