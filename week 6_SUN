#listen to the recording#

#round 1. 25896#

partial secondayr ideas:
      i did not understand the oringinal speech cery well in the first place. 
    
does not have the oringinal logic:
      lack of active listening. 
      need to pay attention to logic and linkings when active listening.


important details:
      very partial.
      


pay attention to the chinese syntax.

speak slower.

use pauses to think about what you are going to say next.




filler:

#end of practice#

i think i still need to listen actively to the speech

sometimes i use too much brain energ to think about how to represent a certain thing. so that i did not listen actively. 
i think you should understand that not everything should or even can be noted down during a consecutive interpreting. 
though you should try to note everthing down when you are practicing. please do not attempt to do so in an exam.
