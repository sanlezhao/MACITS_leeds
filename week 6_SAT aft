#peer practice #

i need to pay specific attention to numbers. i got them worng multiple times today.

omission of details

failure to dicipher notes

i should pay more attention to the conclusion. it is as important as introduction. containing main ideas.
you can not have the main ideas wrong if you are active listening to a speech. distortion only happens when you are not even listening.
