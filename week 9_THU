#reflecting yesterday#s performance 

i thought i gave a bad performance yesterday. 
as i hestitated a lot, and the overall fluencey fluency of the speech is not good at all. 
also i failed to decipher some of my notes. need to listen more actively.

i need to do more work on deverbalizaiton 

my interpretation was awkward regarding use of language. as i did not do enough work to deverbalzie. i focus too much on words instead of meanings.

ur interpretation is supposed to be shorter than the oringinal. 

WORK OUT WHAT IS THE CENTRAL INFORMATION AND WHAT IS NOT!
usually the topic sentence is where central information lies
u need to catach the CENTRAL WORDS in a trunck of informaiton.

#listen to the recording 

filler: suoyi 

did not get the intended meaning of the speech  watsoever

failure to udnerstand the key word leads to major distortion. MASSIVE disotortion. 

#IS Class 

i did rubbish interpretation today. this significantly hinders my ability to do any interpretation when i cam eback home. i am upset. 
i worked fairly hard (at least i think so), and i know i am not the kind of person that works ineffectively. so today my performance was not very encouraging.
there is clearly many many more things to be done. perhaps more than i have imagined.

i did very very bad on numbers. i should work on that.
also. this week's topic in gerneral. more back ground research needs to be conducted.

u do not have common sense regarding political and economical issue. try u best to do sth about it.
