i felt sleepy in today's calss!! 
today's class (or at least part of the class) is about different kinds of translation.. 

MODL 5044M IS

i found out that the interpreting skill class taught by her is less intensive than the one taught by him.
so i need to find an agency to do conference interpreting
i need to enlarge my copora, and broaden my horizon.
i need to be more active in class for sure. 
prepare at least two speaches every week.
god it has been three weeks but i literally feel like it's just three days...

during interpretation, i need to extract the meaning , and retell it in the language i feel comfortable with. paraphrase the sentences so to speak.
DO NOT GET TRAPED BY THE ORINGINAL SENTENCE STRUCTURE!!
**在口译种，道理也是一样，增词不增意**
