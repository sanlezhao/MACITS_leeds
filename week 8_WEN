#interpreting skills#

i failed my interpreting mid term exam, and there is a lot to be impropved.

active listening should take 70 percent of your listening process. notes are just reminding you that particular section of the speech. 
YOU DO NOT INTERPRETE FORM THE NTOES. YOU INTERPRETE FROM YOUR MEMORY. NOTES ARE JUST PROMPTS. 

tendency observed from privous practice:
1. paying no attention to the untterence delivering during interpretation.
2. fail to recognize the subtle difference between different framings of sentences.
3. fail to realize that as an interpreter. everything you have said count. therefore, be careful of what u are saying. 
4. paying to much attention on note taking, resulting in poor active listening. consequently, missing out links. thus, interpretation poorly structured and does not make sense.
5. fail to comprehend the source speech fully. resulting in delivering distorted information. 


what to do to improve:
1. read after the radio. familiarize yourself with the flow of utterance. have better knowledge regarding how the meaning goes with the pauses and the stresses.
2. record your interpretation and LISTEN TO THE RECORDING. when u spot awkward sentence structure/ grammar/etc.., reconstruct the sentence. 
3. listen to ur interpretation recording. check if the logic flows and if the speech is coherent. is it self contradictory? does it make sense?
4. intensive practice on active listening.
5. always take notes after you have actively listened.
