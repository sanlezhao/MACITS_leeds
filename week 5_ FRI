#slef practice#

first round:

note taking:
  almost lose all the linking words 
  missed out (or misarragne) the truly important information
  
one of the reasons i did badly is that i was occupied too much by note-taking. i was taking much of the brain capacity to think about how to note things down.

listen to the recording:
  repetition-- as a result of unclear recall & having difficulty decipher the notes
  add to much tone-- information distortion
  only part of the ideas come across 
  pay too much attention on words instead of the meanings 
  (pay too much attention to the words) 中文原语干扰痕迹明显
