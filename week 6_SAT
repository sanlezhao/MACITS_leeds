#review the speech practiced yesteray#

i think one of the reasons i cannot recall the details of the speech is that i did not listen actively. therefore, i do not really understand the speech.
otherwise, you can recall many content (info blouck) with a few hints on your notepads. 


#peer practice #

i need to pay specific attention to numbers. i got them worng multiple times today.

omission of details

failure to dicipher notes

i should pay more attention to the conclusion. it is as important as introduction. containing main ideas.
you can not have the main ideas wrong if you are active listening to a speech. distortion only happens when you are not even listening.
