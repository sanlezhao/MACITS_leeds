secondary ideas:  distortion-- misunderstanding-- rare beer as *red beer 
                  distortion-- failure of deciphering your notes
                  loss of the speaker's own stand
important details:  wrong tense 
                    wrong tone (没有注意到猜测的虚拟语气)
                    miss major details in almost all diea trunks 
coherence and logic:  partially
                      did not understand the logic glow of the oringinal speech
                      wrong logic 

language: vague pronounciation at some point
          miss use of language: site map-- 卫星地图


delivery: fluency needs to be improved 
          hesitations 
          
**LOGIC AND CONHERENCE NEED TO BE IMPROVED** 

DO NOT FORGET THAT YOU HAVE MEMORY 


#speech practice#

hesitations-- result of thinkging in Chinese 

repetition-- bad sentence construction-- not sure what to way

do not use contractions: although instead of though

pay attention to the logic and coherence of the speech
