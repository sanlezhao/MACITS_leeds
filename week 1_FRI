active listening means to have the information organized into a SYSTEMATIC STRUCTURE in your mind WHILE LISTENING. 

Things to consider: what the speaker is trying to achieve? (speaker's intention)
                    
                    is the speaker persuading/giving some info/telling a story...?
                    
                    why the speaker say this (speaker's intention)
                    
                    what the speaker is saying? (factual info.)
                    
                    how the speaker achieves what he/she wants to achieve? (through facial expression? intonation? body language? what is the logic of the speech?)
                    
                    
you need to have 'meta cognition' of the speech. not only the factual info in the speech, but also the effect the speech achieves.

if you follow the speaker's logic, you should be able to draw the same conclusion as the speaker

**STEP INTO THE SPEAKER'S SHOES**

tutor's instructions regarding my performance: 1. more EYECONTACTs with EVERYONE in the room
                                               2. need to work on English grammar. (said 'walk *before* the dog)
                                               3. need to pay attention to the TENSE 
                                               4. look at the speaker during the speech, and pay attention to the facial expression. cuz i failed to recognize a joke in the speech.
                                               5. missed some minor information in my interpretation 


I found that visualizaition is particularly helpful in orgainizing speech's structure

Speaker often starts the speech with news or personal experience, and then links this to the main part of the speech. so the speech opens in a more natural way.
