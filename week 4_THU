#theory & method in translation#

the tutor today impressed me. she looked like she is really paasionate about the things she is doing. she reminds me of myself.
after all we are jsut crazy people doing crazy things..

we need theories to back our translation up. theories can make us make more informed dicisions, and help us make dicisions quicker.

when you need to translate a text. ask yourself, what is the target audience, what is the function of the text, what are the registers like in the source text, time and speace of text reception.

DO NOT STOP THINKING. YOU HAVE A BRAIN FOR A REASON.

do not feel stupid to rise issues with your clients. this is can show that you are dedicate to the job.
