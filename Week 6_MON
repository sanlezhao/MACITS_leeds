#IS class#

i will write a brif summary regarding today's class because i have to review and prepare for tomorrow's exam.

the tutor outlined the exam procedure for next week's consecutive exam.
i will be given the summary & terminologies of the speech i am going to interprete, and have roughly one minute to look through it.
during interpretation. do not be nervous. act as normal, and this applies to tomorrow's exam too.
do not mess up with main ideas. do not provide distorted information. 
acfter listen to the video ACTIVELY, you are given one minute to rehearse your interpretation. make sure you have a clear and fluent opening, and a strong coclusion.
