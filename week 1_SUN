practice first round (7 min.): i have huge gaps between words in my interpretation, and i therefore sounded like siri, worse than siri actually.   
                                i need to convey the ideas of the original speech. i found myself sometimes repeating the sentence structure or producing the same words of the original speech. this is unnecessary.
                                
speech preparation: need to have more intonation (maybe not rising intonation though) in your speech.


practice second round: you need clearer pronounciation.
                       
pratice fourth round: my voice is too low.
                      i missed the linking sentence '..what links to this..'. therefore had bad interpretation at that section. as i actually did not work out the logical connection between parts of information. 
                      
practice fifth round: too much dropping intonation in my utterances, making me sound like an amature english speaker. 
                      'skills' no long vowel between 'k' and 'l'. speaking slowly does not mean you need to change the vowel length in words.
