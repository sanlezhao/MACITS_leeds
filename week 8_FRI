#slef practice in the morning#

listening to the recording:

i am still interpreting from the notes. not from my memory 

apparant hesitation

repetition

secondary main idea distortion, as i did not understand the oringinal speech at the first place, due to the unfamiliarity of the topic and the lack of background knowledge.

想的是一回事说出来是另一回事--pay attention to self-monitoring 

use ur common sense please. do not rely too much on speech. think about it when u r about to say it.

addition.
