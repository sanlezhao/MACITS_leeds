#slef practice in the morning#

listening to the recording:

i am still interpreting from the notes. not from my memory 

apparant hesitation

repetition

secondary main idea distortion, as i did not understand the oringinal speech at the first place, due to the unfamiliarity of the topic and the lack of background knowledge.

想的是一回事说出来是另一回事--pay attention to self-monitoring 

use ur common sense please. do not rely too much on speech. think about it when u r about to say it.

addition. 

#self practice second round#

topic sentence missing twice

numbers have to be attached to references. otherwise it is meaningless 

part of the links missing.  

interpretation not coherent dut to the lack of topic sentence. PLS TO REMAIN THE LOGIC LINKS IN THE ORINGINAL SPEECH!

accuracy of numbers
