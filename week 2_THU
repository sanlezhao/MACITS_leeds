the mid exam oral presentation will be in week 6. 

my expreience with all the presentation i'v given today is that: do not make your topic too broad! the logic between ideas will just be vague when you have a very broad topic.
also, make sure you activate your relevant vocabs before you're about to give a presentation on a certain topic.

i need a speech pool notebook haha.

please do yourself and your audience a favor: make your English sentences short.

i should pay more attention to my intonation, and make my presentation more inviting. use pauses wisely, and do not just shooting out all of my sentences. it makes the presentation hard to understand, and the audience may have difficulties digesting it.

avoid using complicated tense, simple past tense is your best friend.

READ READ READ. read newspaper, boradpapers, novels.

stick to the UK english yeah?

today's class was about the genre of translation.
so before you translate, consider what genre is your text in? so that you can use proper registers.
an interesting thing to think about is that are all types of news following the same frame work? in the same shape?

i should start from the lower level, and then build up. you can't be the world's best interpreter overnight. you have to practice over and over and over......

when listening to the radio when commuting, i am just braodly listening, without activate listening to the content.
therefore, you need to have out-of-class some active listening time, following each week's topic.

when listening to the speech, you are not just listening, you are also analyzing. DO USE YOUR BRAIN WHILE LISTENING TO THE SPEECH. YOU HAVE A BRAIN FOR A REASON.
