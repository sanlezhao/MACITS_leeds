note-taking:  fail to note down the tones 
              fail to note down the linking words 
              wrong numbers-- used brain energy to review what was said before  
              
              
              
interpretation:
rely too heavily on notes-- left everything that is not on the notes out: this is problematic, as you just can not note everything down. you have to memorize at lest some of them
completeness: loss major details-- due to failure of noting down correctly & rely too heavily on notes
