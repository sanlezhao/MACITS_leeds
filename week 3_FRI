#interpreting practice#

i felt that my presentation skill still needs to be improved for sure.. 
the logic of my presentation was not very clear. this could be becasue that i did not have a clear structure in the preparation stage.
i especially should avoid long sentences. short sentences help with the understanding, and avoid confusion.
i should a couple of very well-prepared speeches at hand. these speech should conver a wide range of issues.


#English as a retour#
i did not feel too bad about my presentation today. i think that is because i felt calm when giving presentation, and this helped with the pauses and intonations.
according to the feedback, i still need to work on my intonation tough. 
i need to make the audience feel more engaged.
i had the eyecontact, so that is good.
i should particularly avoid using "so" as the filler.
