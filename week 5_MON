#practice at home#

after doing the interpretation, i did not feel too bad.
because i did not try to READ my notes. i largely depended on my memory.
i noted down clues for my memory. therefore i did not have to focus too much on my notes, and started to pay attention to my output.

noted down fewer things in one page did help.

but i also found that i used too much brain energy on thinking about how to note things down, adn this interfered with my ACTIVE LISTENING.

redundancy is still a problem 

repetition. cannot get on with it.

spend too much time turning pages 

do not omit words. 
(e.g. we divided () into XXX)

but i did seem to stop recalling and relied to much on notes when delivering interpretation
