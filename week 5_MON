#practice at home#

after doing the interpretation, i did not feel too bad.
because i did not try to READ my notes. i largely depended on my memory.
i noted down clues for my memory. therefore i did not have to focus too much on my notes, and started to pay attention to my output.

noted down fewer things in one page did help.

but i also found that i used too much brain energy on thinking about how to note things down, adn this interfered with my ACTIVE LISTENING.

redundancy is still a problem 

repetition. cannot get on with it.

spend too much time turning pages 

do not omit words. 
(e.g. we divided () into XXX)

but i did seem to stop recalling and relied to much on notes when delivering interpretation




#interpreting skill#

as an interpreter, one of the very important skills we need to master is to deduct things we've missed in accordance to the cotext and the context and your background research.
you will miss some words in interpretation. but interpreting is not about the words themselves anyway. 
INTERPRETING IS ABOUT THE MEANINGS OF THE WORDS.

what you need to pay attention to in interpretation:
1. the way the speech is delivered
2. the context 
3. the cotext 
4. your anticipation while ACTIVE LISTENING

when multiple metaphors are involved in the speech. you CAN get rid of the metaphors in your interpretation as long as you can get the MEANING ACROSS

today's class reminds me again that one single sentence in a speech can contain more than one important main ideas. 

we can infer the meanings even when we miss the words.

IT IS OK TO MISS SOME WORDS. PANICKING WILL NOT HELP YOU MEMNORIZE ANYTHING ANYWAY.


#peer practice#

i applied wrong agent to an action 

i used present tense where past tense is needed

use proper collocations.

i omitted word again. (e.g. green house (gases))

can use more intonations
