when practicing you should always ask yourself: what is effective and what is not. 

to practice proper active listening and note taking. from now on u can try to write notes after the actively listening to the whole speech. 

when delivering Chinese interpretation. make the speech sytactically and morphologically simpler.

Topic Sentences are very important. some times they can be fairly short. therefore, u need to listen.

u do not have to literally listen very hard to the source speech. this only makes u focus even more on words. u should step back a bit and try to analyze the whoel speech.
